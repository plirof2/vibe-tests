==========================================
This is the full description of the game I try to immitate:

Footballer of the Year is a 1986 football management and arcade game developed by Gremlin Graphics for the ZX Spectrum (and other 8-bit platforms like the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC). It combines strategic management with action sequences, putting players in the role of a footballer aiming to become the top player in the English league. Below is a detailed description of its full features based on available information about the ZX Spectrum version.
Core Gameplay

Objective: You start as a 17-year-old player in Division 4, aiming to rise through the English football leagues (Divisions 4 to 1) and earn the prestigious "Footballer of the Year" title by accumulating the most goals and votes.
Dual Gameplay:
Management/Strategy: Plan your career by managing finances, selecting matches, and buying "goal cards" to influence game outcomes.
Arcade/Action: Play out goal-scoring opportunities in short, skill-based sequences.


Key Features

Career Progression:
Begin in Division 4 with a modest salary (£50/week) and limited goal cards (3).
Progress through Divisions 4, 3, 2, and 1 by scoring goals and earning votes from match performances.
Each season, your performance (goals scored) determines promotion, relegation, or retention in your current division.
The ultimate goal is to win the "Footballer of the Year" award, awarded based on total goals and votes across all divisions.

Management Mechanics:
Goal Cards: Before each match, you can purchase up to 10 goal cards (at £500 each, later £1000 in higher divisions) to create scoring opportunities. Each card represents a chance to attempt a goal in the arcade sequence.
Match Selection: Choose which league matches to focus on (up to 10 per season). Selecting fewer matches increases the impact of each goal card but risks missing opportunities.
Finances: Manage your weekly salary (increases with division promotions) to afford goal cards. Poor financial planning can limit your scoring chances.
Incident Cards: Random events (e.g., injuries, bookings, or bonuses) drawn before matches can affect your performance, finances, or availability. For example:
Injuries may prevent you from playing.
Bonuses (like "TV Appearance" for £1000) boost your funds.
Negative events (like "Booked for Diving") may deduct funds or affect votes.


Arcade Goal-Scoring Sequences:
When a goal card is used, you enter a short action sequence to score:
The screen shows a top-down view of the penalty area.
You control the player, timing a pass from a teammate and shooting past defenders and the goalkeeper.
Success depends on quick reflexes and precise timing to aim the shot (using keyboard or joystick controls).

Each successful goal adds to your season tally and increases your votes for the Footballer of the Year award.
The number of attempts per match depends on how many goal cards you allocated.

Season Structure:
Each season consists of a series of matches (up to 10, based on your selection).
After matches, you receive:
A performance summary (goals scored, votes earned).
Random incident card effects.
Updates on your division standing and finances.

At season’s end, the game calculates promotions/relegations and announces the Footballer of the Year based on total goals and votes.

Leagues and Teams:
Features four divisions (Division 1 to 4), loosely based on the English Football League structure of the 1980s.
Teams are fictional but inspired by real clubs (e.g., "Mancaster" for Manchester United).
You face varied opponents, with difficulty scaling slightly as you climb divisions (e.g., better goalkeepers in Division 1).

Cup Competitions:
Includes a simplified FA Cup and European Cup (if you qualify by reaching higher divisions).
These are single-elimination tournaments with arcade sequences for goal attempts, offering extra prestige and financial rewards for winning.

Transfer System:
At the end of each season, you may receive transfer offers from other clubs (in the same or higher divisions).
Accepting a transfer can increase your salary and goal card allowance, but you must weigh the risk of moving to a tougher division.

Retirement:
Your career ends at age 31 (after ~14 seasons).
The game tracks your total goals, awards, and career highlights, encouraging replay to beat your previous records.


ZX Spectrum-Specific Features

Graphics and Sound:
Simple but colorful 2D sprites typical of the ZX Spectrum’s 48K capabilities.
Management screens use text-heavy menus with basic icons for players, cards, and pitches.
Arcade sequences feature a top-down pitch view with animated players and a scrolling effect for shots.
Minimal sound: Beeps for actions (e.g., shots, goals) and basic jingles for menus or season transitions. No in-game music due to hardware limits.
