 MANIC MINER
 Software Projects 1983

 CONTROLS : Keyboard, Kempston
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 AIM : In his first appearance, Miner Willy is trying to strike it rich
 and collect all the keys to the mine in which he works.

 GAMEPLAY : On each of the twenty levels are several keys, which you
 must collect before your oxygen supply runs out. Having collected the
 keys you must then go to the exit to go on to the next level.

 COMMENTS : "The all-time classic of arcade games on the Spectrum."
            (Sinclair User)

 NOW : This was the game that spawned a thousand clones. MM was the
 original ladders and levels game from which all others are (reputedly)
 descended and is, needless to say, a classic. It is still surprisingly
 playable, even if the theme tune is unforgivably bad...
