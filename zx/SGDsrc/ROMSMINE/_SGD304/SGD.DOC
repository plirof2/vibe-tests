1. REQUIREMENTS
---------------
In order to be able to use this program you will need the following resources:

- HARDWARE:
  - A 80386 or better processor,
  - A (Super)VGA card with at least 256Kb,
  - A mouse with a fully Microsoft compatible driver
    (Microsoft compatibility version 6.26 or up),
  - At least 4Mb of memory,

- SOFTWARE:
  - (MS)DOS 5.0 or better,
  - A copy of the free DOS/4GW runtime.

Additionally, you will need:
- Loads of Spectrum games :)
- One of the supported emulators if you want to play the games.


See HISTORYS.DOC for the latest changes.
Notice that the 16-bit version has been discontinued!


2. IMPORTANT NOTES
------------------
If you want to use options that are not yet in your configuration file,
simply start SGD, choose `Config' and `Save'. This writes the configuration
file back, but with the new options added (at their default values).

 1. If a fatal error occurs, you will be asked if an attempt should be made to
    rescue the database (if it had been changed). If a successful attempt was
    made, the database will be in the file `GAMES.SAV'.
    You must rename this file to `GAMES.DAT' yourself before restarting.
 2. If the following fatal error occurs after writing back a changed database:
    `Could not install new database', or `Could not remove old database', the
    version just written will have an extension `.TMP' (in the same directory
    as the old database).
    You must rename this file yourself before restarting.
 3. Since v1.35, SGD runs perfectly well in a Windows DOS box.
    Special considerations are:
    - Set variable `NoLocalMouseHiding' in TAPER.INI to `On' (if running NT);
 4. Although this program runs fine in a DOS-box from Windows, this is not the
    recommended setup, as the Spectrum emulator doesn't like Windows that much
    (and neither should you)! Also see the Troubleshooting section on Windows.
    Make sure you allow use of the upper memory area, as this frees a large
    amount of precious conventional memory.
 5. When you choose to validate the database, remember that using a diskcaching
    program (such as SMARTDRV) will do miracles.
 6. The maximum filesize for a game is currently 7 digits. Please let me know if
    you have larger (`.VOC') files and you want to include them too.
 7. Some options (eg. poking a game) need a temporary directory to be defined.
    In DOS, you define this with the command (in your AUTOEXEC.BAT)
      SET TMP=<path>
    Windows users will probably have a `TEMP' setting instead.
    SGD will look for `TMP' first. If this is not set it will look for `TEMP'.
    If neither one is set, it will use the SGD directory.
    If you start SGD from a floppy or CD-ROM, you MUST have one of `TMP' or
    `TEMP'!
    If you want some real speed, create a RAM disk and make `TMP' point to it.


3. GETTING STARTED
------------------
You are encouraged to read this entire document before starting on your first
database, so you will understand the steps.

 1. Start SGD without a [databasename]. This will start using the default name
    'GAMES.DAT'.
 2. Click on the `Config' button.
    In the upper right corner of the configuration window, you will see a block
    `Emulator'.
    a. The topmost option is `Emulator Type'. Select the type of emulator you
       will be using.
    b. The option right below it is `Emulator Path'. Use the browse button to
       the right of this field to select the starting command of your emulator.
    Now select button `Save' to save this setup, and select `Use'.
    The configuration window will be closed.
    For more information about the configuration window, refer to
    `The Configuration' further in this document.
 3. Press the right mouse button and keep it pressed. You will see the menu
    strip at the top of the screen.
    While keeping the right mouse button pressed, move your mouse over the left
    menu option `Database'. The menu will expand. While still keeping the right
    mouse button pressed, move to the submenu option `Search For Games'.
    When your mouse pointer is over this option, release the right mouse button.
    (For more information about the menu strip, refer to `The Menu Strip'
    further in this document).
    You will now have a filerequester on your screen.
    Use this filerequester to browse to the (first) directory where you put your
    Spectrum games, then select `Ok'.
    SGD will now search this directory and all subdirectories for Spectrum games
    and ask you which ones should be included into your database.
    If you have more directories with games, repeat this step.
 4. Click on the `Save' button on your screen.

 Congratulations! You have your very first ready-to-run database now!

 As you will see, the left window has a list of all games you included.
 All games that cannot be played with the emulator you set up in the first step
 are printed in red.
 You can now either double-click on a name in the left window, or click once and
 click on the `Play' button to start playing each game.

 The game list is composed of the game filenames, without extensions.
 This works perfectly well, although you will probably want some more
 descriptive names (say, the full game's name).
 This has to be changed manually (of course).
 To change a name, click on the game entry you wish to rename (left window).
 The right window is used to show/edit information about this particular game.
 The topmost field, `Name', is what you are looking for. Click on this field to
 get a cursor and type the name you want. When you're done, either use the [TAB]
 or [ENTER] key. The name in the left window will have changed as well, and will
 automatically be sorted into place.


4. SYNTAX
---------
To see what syntax is available, use SGD -?

To start the Spectrum Games Database, use the syntax

  SGD [-cX] [-p] [-w] [-s] [-m] [-u] [databasename]

Option `-cX' (or `/cX', `-CX' or `/CX') is used if you are upgrading your
database.
Use -c1 to convert from version 1.07 or below
Use -c2 to convert from version 1.09 or below
Use -c3 to convert from version 1.17 or below
Use -c4 to convert from version 1.21 or below
Use -c5 to convert from version 1.29 or below
Use -c6 to convert from version 1.30 or below
Use -c7 to convert from version 1.35 or below
Use -c8 to convert from version 2.01 or below
All databases 1.10 and up will be auto-converted, so options `-c3', `-c4',
`-c5', `-c6', `-c7' and `-c8' are not required.

Option `-p' is used to disable the load/save percentage bar, which is useful
if you have a slower computer or a really slow video card.

Option `-w' is used to disable MS Windows `multitasking' if it is detected.
It will be enabled again once you leave SGD. This should be used with caution.
This option works on Windows 3.x in enhanced mode and on Windows95/98.
Of course, programs run from the shell (such as a ZX Spectrum emulator) will
still detect that Windows is running and act accordingly, but emulation will
be a lot faster and more accurate.
This option should not be used when using the `WSpecEm' or `ZX-32' Spectrum
emulator!

Option `-s' disables use of a Soundcard. Use this if your machine crashes on
soundcard detection, or if you don't want SGD to lock your soundcard under
Windows.

Option `-m' disables handling of a software Mixer on the detected soundcard.
Use this option only if your machine cannot handle this.

Option `-u' disables use of Upper memory.
Obsolete option...

The [databasename] may be omitted, which is defaulted to `GAMES.DAT'. If you
want to use a different database, remember that any rescued database is
ALWAYS named `GAMES.SAV' in the SGD directory!
Any database printed to a file will get extension `.OUT' and will be in the same
directory as the database itself.


5. THE SCREEN
-------------
The screen is set up in a 640x480x16 resolution and contains two windows.
The left window holds the Spectrum games stored in the current database file,
the right window is the description window that contains information on the
game that is currently being selected.

The game information window (the right window) contains the following fields:

Name        - Name of the game.
Year        - Year of publication.
Publisher   - Publisher of the game.
Author(s)   - Author(s) of the game.
Memory      - Possible values are
              "16", which means it's a 16K game,
              "48", which means it's a 48K-only game,
              "128", which means it's a 128K-only game,
              "48/128", which means it can be loaded in both 48K and 128K mode.
              (this value is printed as "4/1").
              "USR0", which means it's a 128K game that loads in USR 0 mode.
              (this value is printed as "US0").
              "+2/+2A", which means it's a 128K/+2/+2A-only game,
              "+3", which means it's a 128K/+3-only game,
              "Pentag", which means it's a Pentagon-only game,
              The selected emulator memory type is 48K for values "16" and "48",
              128K for the others, unless the emulator understands differences;
# Players   - Number of players that can participate;
Together    - If more than one player, can all players play at the same time?
Score       - How well do you like the game?
PC-Name     - Filename of the game and size of the file.
Type        - Descriptive game type.
Joysticks   - Supported joysticks.
Orig Screen - Does the snapshot (tapefile) have the original loading screen?
Origin      - Where does this version come from?
              Possible values are
              " " = (unknown)
              "O" = Original release
              "R" = Re-release
              "C" = Compilation release
              "M" = Magazine conver-tape version
              "T" = Type-in
              "H" = Hacked/cracked version
              "I" = Incomplete version
              "B" = Buggered/corrupted version
AY-Sound    - Does the game have AY sound?
MultiLoad   - Does the game load extra parts (levels)?
              "yes" means the game is multi-load in either 48K or 128K,
              "48K" means the game is multi-load only when loaded in 48K mode,
              "no" means the game is not multi-load at all.
              Also refer to `MultiLoad Games' further in this document.
Language    - Message language of the game.
Override    - Use a different emulator for this specific game than the one you
              defined in your configuration. Use "none" to use the set up one.
              Some games simply don't run on your favorite emulator. Using an
              override will keep you from constantly changing your config.

The lower part of this window is used for the `Screen', `List' and `ScrShot'
button output.
At the bottom of this window is the name of the current database printed,
together with a checkmark if the database has been changed.

The order of emulator selection for a game is (strongest first):
1. Override button attached to the entry,
2. Extension Link as set up in the configuration,
3. The default emulator as set up in the configuration.

The fields in this window can also be selected with the [TAB]/[ENTER] keys.
[TAB] cycles clockwise, [SHIFT] + [TAB] cycles counter-clockwise.

Between these two windows you will find the following buttons:

Add     - Add an entry to the database. After filling in the name of the game,
          the new entry will be sorted into the database.
Del     - Delete the game that is currently selected. Note that the game will
          only be removed from the database, the game file itself will be left
          alone. Confirmation is asked if this is set in the configuration.
Write   - Write the database back to disk. This is also done if you leave the
          application.
Reload  - Re-read the database from disk.
Print   - Print the database to the printer.
          You will find a `Select' button in the print requester to configure
          which fields (and in what order) are to be printed.

Play    - Play the selected game in the selected emulator.
          - If the game is not in a snapshot file, you will have to type
            LOAD "" first to load the game, unless configuration option
            `Auto-Load Tapes' was turned on.
            Auto-Loading is not implemented for +2/+2A, +3 and Pentagon
            software (as these models are not supported in the Z80 snapshot
            format!)
          - `.MDR' files are put into microdrive 1.
          - 128K games use the 128K Spectrum.
Poke    - Play the selected game, but insert cheat-pokes first.

Config  - Configure the application.
Shell   - Shell out to DOS.
          WARNING: you must not start TSR programs from within the shell, or the
          application will not be able to swap back in!
          If MS Windows multitasking has been disabled, it is still disabled
          while you're in a shell.
Quit    - Stop.

Screen  - Find and display the Spectrum screen contained in the game. If the
          game is in a tape file, the first screen in the tape is taken.
List    - TAP files: creates a catalog of the tape (see below for format);
          TZX files: creates a catalog of the tape (see below for format);
          MDR files: creates a catalog of the microdrive cartridge, very much
                     like you type `CAT 1' on the Spectrum (see below);
                     If the cartridge is write protected, this is reported in
                     blue after the cartridge name (first line).
          Z80 files: gives some information as found in the header.
          SLT files: as Z80 files, but also reports some information about the
                     extension blocks.
          Others   : gives nothing, as nothing interesting can be found in the
                     header!
ScrShot - View a saved screenshot (.SCR) file. See `Game Screenshot Files' for
          more information. SLT files only show a screenshot if it is included
          in the snapshot (as extension).

Info    - View the game information file (see below).
EdInfo  - Edit the game information file in a seperate task.
EdPoke  - Edit the game pokes file (see below).

Help    - View this file.
About   - Shows an about box.
SysInfo - Shows some system information.

The buttons can be selected in two ways:

1. By clicking on them,
2. By pressing [ALT] + the underlined character.

You can make a snapshot (GIF image) of the full screen at any time by pressing
[CTRL][Print Screen]. In each session, the first screen dump will be called
SDUMP001.GIF, the next SDUMP002.GIF etc.

When a Spectrum screen is being displayed, you can press [ALT][G] to convert
this image to a GIF file, which will be created in the directory you assign in
the configuration file (`GIFPath' value). The name of the image will have the
same PC-name as the game, with extension `.GIF'


6. THE FILL-IN FIELDS
---------------------
The fields `Name', `Publisher', `Author(s)', `Year', `Players', `Score',
`PC-Name' and `Type' can be edited. Click on it to get a cursor. The keys are:

[CURSOR LEFT]  - One char left;
[CURSOR RIGHT] - One char right;
[HOME]         - Go to the start of the box;
[END]          - Go to the end of the box;
[BACKSPACE]    - Delete the character before the cursor;
[DEL]          - Delete the character under the cursor;
[INS]          - Toggle insert/overstrike mode (the startup mode is set in the
                 configuration window);
[ENTER]        - Accept the input and elect next button;
[TAB]          - Accept the input and elect next button;
[SHIFT][TAB]   - Accept the input and elect previous button;
[ESC]          - Restore and stop editing;

[CTRL] and one of:

[CURSOR LEFT]  - One word left;
[CURSOR RIGHT] - One word right;
[HOME]         - Go to the start of the input field;
[END]          - Go to the end of the input field;
[DEL]          - Clear the entire input field.
B              - Clear Beginning of input field up to the cursor;
E              - Clear from the cursor to the End of the input field;
W              - Clear from the cursor to the start of the next Word;
P              - This keystroke is remapped to the pound sign (`œ');

Any ASCII character inserts the character.
The fields `Year', `Players' and `Score' only accept numerical characters.
If you start editing, overstrike or insert mode is selected depending on the
configuration.

You can use `{' and `}' sequences in the `Name' field (see `The Game Information
File' for a list) to alter the appearance of the name in the select window.
For example, you could use `{B' to make the entry appear in bold.
These sequences are ignored when using the typed-name feature and when printing
the database.

I usually use the `Type' field as follows:

Arc       for arcade games;
Adv       for text adventure games;
Arc/Adv   for arcade adventure games;
Sim       for simulation games;
Str       for strategy games;
Spo       for sports games;
Brd       for board/card games;
Lrn       for learning 'games';
Dem       for games demos;
Bld       for `building' software for games (e.g. The Quill);


7. SELECTING A GAME
-------------------
Games are selected from the left window. The current game's name is inverted.
To select another game, either move the slider and click on it with the mouse
or use the keys:

[CURSOR UP]   - Move one game up;
[CURSOR DOWN] - Move one game down;
[PAGE UP]     - Move a page up;
[PAGE DOWN]   - Move a page down;
[INS]         - Play the game;
[CTRL][HOME]  - Move to the first game;
[CTRL][END]   - Move to the last game;
[CTRL][INS]   - Toggle the `selected' status of the game.

If the configuration option 'Always select game' is turned on, the right
window (description window) will change accordingly as you move around.

If you have set up a selection criterion, you can use the key [CTRL] with

[CURSOR UP]   - Move one selected game up;
[CURSOR DOWN] - Move one selected game down;

To toggle the `selected' status of a game with the mouse, hold down [CTRL] or
the middle mouse button (if you have a 3-button mouse) while clicking on the
game name.

You can toggle the `selected' status of an entire range of games at once (with
the mouse only!) by selecting the entry at the beginning of the range and then
selecting the last entry in the range while pressing [SHIFT].

`Selected' games are printed with a cyan background.

The slider can be used as follows:
- Pick up the slider and drag it to the position you want;
- Hold down [CTRL] or the middle mouse button and click somewhere on the
  slider bar to set the slider to that position directly;
- Click above the slider to go up a page (repeated while pressed);
- Click below the slider to go down a page (repeated while pressed);
- or use the arrow gadgets to go up/down a line (repeated while pressed);

You may also use the Typed-Name feature: Start typing the name of the game.
Each time you add or delete a character, the database will be searched for the
closest match to a game name. The selection bar will be on that entry.
Pressing [ESC] or selecting the entry will clear the typed-name box.
Note that you do not have to insert spaces or other typographical characters;
these are ignored when matching.

Games that can not be played in the currently used emulator are printed in red.

When you double-click a game name, the game is automatically started.


8. THE SELECTION CRITERION
--------------------------
At the bottom of the left window is a box with an `S' before it.
This is the box where you can enter your selection criterion.
Eighteen different criteria are included, which use the following names:

Name Is          Type

NM   Name        (AlphaNum)
PU   Publisher   (AlphaNum)
AU   Authors     (AlphaNum)
BY   [special]   (AlphaNum)  Searches both Publisher and Authors
YR   Year        (Num)
ME   Memory      (Num)
PL   Players     (Num)
TO   Together    (Bool)
PC   PC-Name     (FileName)
TP   Type        (AlphaNum)
PB   PlayBit     (Bool)
OS   OrigScr     (Bool)
OR   Origin      (AlphaNum)  Single char
AY   AY-Sound    (Bool)
ML   MultiLoad   (Bool)
FD   FloppyDisk  (Num)
LN   Language    (AlphaNum)
SC   Score       (Num)

The syntax is simple:
AlphaNum types are followed by `=' or `!=' (or '<>') and a string, in which the
         wildcard characters `*' and `?' may be used;
         If you want to use characters `*' or `?' or `,' but not with their
         special meaning, insert a `\' before it.
         (For example `\?' is no wildcard, but a `real' question mark)
FileName types are handled almost the same as AlphaNum types, but follow the
         (extended) DOS convention for wildcard handling.
Num      types are followed by `>', `<', `=', `>=', `<=' or `!=' (or '<>') and
         a number;
Bool     types are followed by a `=' and a `Y' or `N'.

Lettercase is not important.

NOTE: 'not-equal-to' can be given as both '!=' (C-style) or '<>' (BASIC-style).

The single wildcard `*' in a string can be used to find empty fields, e.g.
  pu=*    will find all entries with publisher field filled in, whereas
  pu!=*   will find all entries with an empty publisher field.

Empty numerical fields are defaulted to 0, so
  yr<1990 will find all entries with year field filled in, released before 1990,
  yr>0    will find all entries with year field filled in, and
  yr=0    will find all entries with an empty year field.

The PlayBit value is not really a database field. It checks the `playable' bit
in the select window (which makes the entry red if not set).

The FloppyDisk value can be used to find out which games are located on a
particular floppy disk. Use 'fd=0' to find all games NOT on a floppy.

The MultiLoad value returns TRUE if the game value is either "yes" or "48K".

The Memory value is a bit tricky. The values are defined as follows:
  "16"       - returns 16
  "48"       - returns 48
  "128"      - returns 128
  "48/128"   - returns 176
  "USR0"     - returns 129
  "+2/+2A"   - returns 130
  "+3"       - returns 131
  "Pentagon" - returns 228

So, to find all games that can be loaded in both 48K and 128K, use criterion
  me=176
To find all games that are played in 128K mode, use
  me>=128
To find all games that are played in 48K mode, use
  me<=48
Note that `USR0' applies to 128K programs that must be loaded in `USR 0' mode.

Multiple criteria are joined with a `,' character (no spaces!). For example:

  yr>=1985,pl=2,to=y,pc=*.tap,os=y

will select all games since 1985 that can be played by two players together,
that are in tape files and contain the original loading screen.

The first character of the criterion determines what is to be done:
If it is '+', matching entries are added to the already selected entries,
(it works as a logical OR)
If it is '-', matching entries are removed from the already selected entries,
(it works as a logical NAND)
If it is '=' or something else, only the criterion determines which entries are
selected or deselected.

For example, if you issue criterion
  yr=1985
and then criterion
  +yr=1986
all games from 1985 or 1986 are selected.

- Games that cannot be played with the selected emulator are printed in red.
- Games that match the criterion are printed with a cyan background.

Apart from using the criterion, you can (de)select entries by hand: press
[CTRL] or the middle mouse button (if your mouse has 3 buttons) while clicking
on a game.

You can toggle the `selected' status of an entire range of games at once (with
the mouse only!) by selecting the entry at the beginning of the range and then
selecting the last entry in the range while pressing [SHIFT].

If you pass an empty selection criterion, all files will be deselected.


9. THE CONFIGURATION
--------------------
The configuration window holds the following items:

Remap Bright Black  : Should the ULA bug be matched and should bright black be
                      displayed as dark black?
Emulate Flash       : If turned on, flash is emulated when drawing Spectrum
                      screens.
Slow Flash          : Normally, flashing is done every 16/50th of a second
                      (as the Spectrum itself does). If you have a slower
                      computer or video card, this may result in loss of
                      responsiveness. In this case, you should turn this
                      option on, in which case flashing is reduced to a
                      third of the time (just under a second).
                      Both these options can be toggled from the menu strip.
Confirm Quit        : User must confirm quit?
Confirm Delete      : User must confirm delete?
Confirm Overwrite   : If turned on, SGD will ask for confirmation when a file
                      is about to be overwritten (except the database itself).
Follow Slider       : If turned on, a combo window will be updated while you
                      move the slider bar. If turned off, only the slider bar
                      will be updated while moving; the result will be printed
                      when you release the mouse button.
                      This option should be turned off for slower computers
                      only.
Edit Insert         : Sets the initial edit mode for startup of edit buttons.
                      Checked means insert mode, cleared means overstrike mode.
Always Backup       : If this option is turned on (the default), SGD will make
                      a backup of the database the first time that a new
                      version is to be written. This file will have extension
                      `.BAK'
                      This option can be temporarily overridden from the menu.
Always Validate     : If turned on, will auto-validate the paths of all games
                      in the database after a (re)load or import. The default
                      is `off'. This option can be temporarily changed from
                      the menu.
                      Be careful: it can take quite some time to validate if
                      you have a large database.
Always Cheat        : Will link the `Play' button to the `Poke' button if
                      turned on. This option can be temporarily changed from
                      the menu.
Pick Best Screen    : If turned on, will link the `Screen' button to the
                      `ScrShot' button if a screenshot file was found.
                      (ie. overrides the screen in a snapshot).
                      This option can be temporarily changed from the menu.
Always Select Game  : If this option is turned on, SGD will always select the
                      game appointed in the game select window. The default is
                      `On'. You will want to turn it off if you have a slower
                      computer.
                      This option can be temporarily overridden from the menu.
Auto-Load Tapes     : If the image is in a tape file (.TAP, .TZX, .VOC) and the
                      emulator to be used is either Z80, X128 or Warajevo, this
                      option will automatically start the tape loading sequence,
                      unless the memory model is +2/+2A, +3 or Pentagon, since
                      these models are not supported in the Z80 snapshot format.
Start Button        : Can take the following values:
                      0 : Disable this option (default). You will want this
                          option disabled if your games are on floppies;
                      1 : Start with the `Screen' button pressed;
                      2 : Start with the `List' button pressed;
                      3 : Start with the `ScrShot' button pressed;
Disable Sounds      : Disable all sounds from SGD. Be careful: this does NOT
                      turn off the sounds from the emulators (unless `Z80',
                      `X128', or `R80' is used)!
Force Snap Joystick : Normally, SGD will pass the (first) selected joystick in
                      the Game Information Area to the game to be played.
                      `.Z80' and `.SLT' type games don't allow this and will
                      always use the joystick as set in the snapshot.
                      Turn this option on to patch the game (into the TMP
                      directory) with your selected joystick when playing.

Emulator Type       : Type of emulator: `Z80', `JPP', `WARA', `X128', `WSPE',
                      `ZX', `SPAN', `ZX32', `R80' or `RUS'.
                      The displayed emulator is the `default' emulator, which is
                      used unless an `Extension Link' (higher priority) is set
                      or the `Emulator Override' field (highest priority) is
                      used.
Emulator Path       : Full path to the emulator of the chosen type.
                      If you use a `.BAT' file, which will start the emulator in
                      turn, make sure you pass all the parameters "%1" etc too!
Additional Switches : Additional command line switches to be passed to the
                      emulator of the chosen type.
                      `Z80' seems to have problems with some of them this way.

ASCII Editor Path   : The file name of the editor to be used when the `EdInfo'
                      button is pressed. The extension (.COM/.EXE/.BAT) must
                      be given too! If this is a batch file, "%1" holds the
                      information file name. If the editor is not in the
                      current directory nor in the search path, the full path
                      must be supplied.
ZX-Editor Path      : The full path to ZXEDIT.EXE from Claus Jahn and Andy
                      Schraepel.
Always Use ZX-Editor: Turn this option on if you wish to use the ZX-Editor
                      to edit/create all your game info files.

Printer             : 1 for LPT1, 2 for LPT2, 3 for LPT3.
                      0 is used to print to a file instead. The name of the
                      file will have the same name as the database, but with an
                      extension `.OUT'
Lines Per Page      : The number of lines per page that the printer uses.

Blanker Installed   : Use the blanker?
Blanker Time-Out    : Number of seconds of non-keyboard/mouse activity before
                      the blanker activates.

Extensions Links    : Here you can link a specific file type to a specific
                      emulator. For example, if your normal emulator is `Z80',
                      it cannot play `.SP' files. You could use the override
                      button in the main screen for every single entry, or
                      simply link the type to a more suitable emulator
                      (such as the `Spanish Spectrum Emulator').

Button `Save' will save the current configuration, `Reload' will load the
configuration back from disk.
You must explicitely press the `Use' button (or the close gadget or the [ESC]
key) to leave the configuration window.


9.1. THE CONFIGURATION FILE
---------------------------
The file SGD.INI holds the above configuration. Other values are:

DragOutlineOnly     : If turned on, will update only the window's outline
                      while a window is being dragged. This should only be
                      turned off if you have an extremely fast processor and
                      video card (as most windows reside in XMS)
ResizeOutlineOnly   : If turned on, will update only the window's outline
                      while a window is being resized. This should only be
                      turned off if you have an extremely fast processor and
                      video card (as most windows reside in XMS)
StableFloppies      : Assume that Spectrum software on floppies stays there.
                      When turned on (default), SGD will not ask to insert a
                      floppy when you select a game. It will ask for it when
                      you press a button (Play, Screen, List, ScrShot, Info
                      and EdInfo). When turned off, SGD will ALWAYS want the
                      correct floppy in the drive.
PreLoadResources    : Load all font files at startup when set. This will save
                      some floppy swapping when running SGD from floppies and
                      will prevent SGD from getting out of memory a bit.
DirectVideoControl  : Do not use the RIL if one has been detected. This will
                      speed up all screen functions, but can cause a messed up
                      screen if your video card cannot handle it.
SwapInTextMode      : If set, swapping out sets the video mode to MODE 80, no
                      matter what the startup video mode was (when exiting SGD,
                      the original video mode is restored). At least `Z80'
                      needs this or will generate an EMM386 exception error...
QuitInTextMode      : If set, the video mode is forced to MODE 80 on exit of
                      SGD, no matter what the startup video mode was.
                      Some very strange video cards with bugs in their BIOS
                      require this option.

NextFloppyDiskId    : This is the next floppy number to be used. You should
                      NOT edit this field by hand!

UseGeniusMouseHiding: If turned on, will use the old-style Genius mouse hiding
                      function. Turn it on only when you have a Genius mouse
                      driver with version 7.02 or below.
                      This is no longer needed.
NoLocalMouseHiding  : If turned on, will always fully hide the mouse when a
                      request is made to hide in a specific range.
                      This should only be used when you have a really weird
                      mouse driver (e.g. in Windows NT) that messes up the
                      screen. It will slow down the GUI considerably, unless
                      you run under a 32-bit OS.
ForceMouseRelease   : To be used only if you have a weird mouse that seems to
                      be lost (doesn't work in a next application) if you quit.
SwapMouseButtons    : If turned on, will swap the left and right mouse buttons.
SnapMouseDefault    : Turn it on if you want the mouse to move to the default
                      button if a window/requester is drawn or if an edit
                      button is finished with the [ENTER] key (Default is off).
DoubleClickInterval : The maximum time elapse in milliseconds between two mouse
                      clicks to be recognised as a double-click.
InitialContPushDelay: The initial delay in milliseconds when keeping a
                      continuous push button pressed (e.g. the arrow buttons on
                      sliders).
MouseSpeedSetting   : Contains 3 integers, separated with commas;
                      Horizontal mickeys, Vertical mickeys and Double speed
                      threshold. The first 2 values determine how much the mouse
                      pointer moves for each inch you move the mouse (higher
                      value is faster), the last value determines how many
                      pixels the mouse must move before moving at double speed
                      (lower is sooner).
                      This setting is initialized by your mouse driver normally,
                      but can be changed here. The defaults are usually 8,16,64.
                      To always use the values as setup in your mouse config,
                      remove all values after the '='.

GIFPath             : The directory where the GIF files of the Spectrum screen
                      images (created with [ALT][G]) will be stored;
                      You can put GIF files in a directory relative to your
                      games by inserting a `$' character before the path name.
                      For example, if you use only `$', the GIF files will be
                      put in the same directory as the game. If you use `$GIF',
                      the files will be put in a subdirectory `GIF' from your
                      game location.
Z80SnapNeedsTape    : This string is searched for at the end of the game name
                      if this game is in a `.Z80' or `.SNA' file and the chosen
                      emulator is Z80, Warajevo or X128.
                      See `MultiLoad Games' further in this document.
Z80SnapNeedsVOC     : Does the same as Z80SnapNeedsTape, but when the rest of
                      the program is in a `.VOC' file.
                      See `MultiLoad Games' further in this document.
Z80TapesOnly        : Turn this option off if you have both `.TAP' files created
                      with Z80 and `.TAP' files created with Warajevo. The
                      default is on (only Z80).
                      (see below)
ValidateAtEmulChange : If turned on, when changing emulator, SGD will also test
                      if the game is actually there as part of the `playable
                      game' determination.
PhonebookSorting    : If turned on (default, as it was with all previous
                      versions), the sorting of titles is done with an algorithm
                      known as `phonebook' or `dictionary' sorting.
                      Only alpha-numerical characters are considered when
                      sorting. Spaces, commas, etc are skipped.
                      If this option is turned off, every character is
                      considered while sorting.
                      The 'typed name' feature uses the same algorithm.
                      If you change this option, you will want to use the
                      `Resort database' menu option.
AllFilesInOneDir    : If turned on, all extra game related files (screenshots,
                      info, pokes and inlays) are searched for in the game's
                      directory itself rather than the normal subdirectories.
                      This is useful only for several emulation CD's.
GIFViewerPath
GIFViewerOptions
JPGViewerPath
JPGViewerOptions    : All info needed to view TZX `Custom Info - Picture'
                      blocks and game inlay files.
Compressor          : The compression program to be used when using the
                      `Compress games' option from the menu strip.
                      (see below)
CompressOptions     : Any options needed by the above compression program.
                      If more than one option is needed, the argument must be
                      quoted.

AddLanguage         : Add a language to the `Language' drop-down list;
                      (see below)

UseCustomPalette    : See `Using a Custom Palette' below.
CustomColorXX       : See `Using a Custom Palette' below.

The above parameters must be filled in by hand.

GameDir             : All the directories where games from the database are
                      found. GameDir entries are automatically inserted if you
                      select files from the file requester.

This file can be edited with any ASCII editor, but is also rewritten if you
change the configuration.


10. THE MENU STRIP
------------------
SGD has a menu strip a la Amiga. For users unfamiliar with the Amiga, I'll
explain how it works with the mouse:

- To use the menu strip, press the right mouse button. You'll see the strip
  at the top line of the screen;
- While keeping the right button pressed, move it to one of the words in it.
  A roll-down menu will appear;
- While still keeping the right mouse button pressed, move the mouse over the
  menu entry you wish to activate. Entries with an `>>' at the end have a
  submenu attached;
- When the mouse highlights the entry you want, release the right mouse button;
- If you don't want one of the options, move the mouse somewhere in the void
  and release the right mouse button there.
- Some menu entries have key shortcuts. These are shown at the end of a line.

It can also be controlled with the keyboard:

[F9]             - start/stop the menu;
[ESC]            - stop the menu;

While only a menu is shown, without any option highlighted, use:
[CURSOR LEFT]    - One menu section left;
[CURSOR RIGHT]   - One menu section right;

Otherwise:
[CURSOR UP]      - One option up;
[CURSOR DOWN]    - One option down;
[CURSOR LEFT]    - Enter submenu (if available);
[CURSOR RIGHT]   - Leave submenu;

[PAGE UP]        - Go back to the top (menu name);
[PAGE DOWN]      - Go to the last option;

[ENTER]          - Activate the highlighted option.

The menu strip has the following entries:

1. Database
   - New               : Remove the current database from memory and start with
                         an empty one. You will be asked to save first if you
                         changed anything;
                         Notice that the database name will be `NONAME.DAT'.
                         When saving a new database, you should use the menu
                         option `Save As...' to give it a proper name.
   - Open ...          : Remove the current database from memory and open a new
                         one. You will be asked to save first if you changed
                         anything;
   - Save As ...       : This menu has a submenu:
     - All             : Save the entire database to a new file;
     - Selected        : Save only the selected entries to a new file;
   - Print             : This menu has a submenu:
     - All             : Prints the entire database (the same as the button);
     - Selected        : Prints only the selected entries;
   - Import database   : Join another database in memory. The new database will
                         be simply added, so the result will be unsorted.
                         Afterward, the selection bar will be on the first
                         imported line.
   - Resort database   : Resort the database. All entries will be sorted by
                         game name. This option is generally needed when you
                         import a database or if you change the
                         `PhonebookSorting' configuration option.
   - Validate database : This menu has a submenu:
     - All             : Validate the entire database;
     - Selected        : Validate only the selected entries of the database;
   - Compress games    : This menu has a submenu (see below):
     - All             : Compress all games in the database;
     - Selected        : Compress only the selected games of the database;
   - Search for games  : After giving a starting directoy, SGD will search the
                         directory and all subdirectories for games.
                         The raw PC-Name will be used as game name.
                         `GameDir' entries are automatically added.
   - Find new games    : You will get a requester to select which `GaneDir'
                         directories are to be searched for game files that are
                         not yet in the database. All found games can be added
                         to the database. If you check the button 'Use File
                         name as Game name', the raw PC-Name will be used as
                         game name.
                         Be careful: it can take quite some time to search if
                         you have a lot of new games and/or a large database.
   - View screenshot   : This allows you to view a `.SCR' file. A seperate
                         window will be opened with a `Make GIF' button
                         attached. Created GIF files will be put in the same
                         directory as the `.SCR' file, no matter what value you
                         used in the `GIFPath' configuration!

   - Backup database   : If checked, will create a backup of the `old' database
                         before writing a new one (to temporarily override the
                         `Always Backup' option from the configuration window).
   - Auto-validate     : If turned on, will auto-validate the paths of all games
                         in the database after a (re)load or import. The default
                         is `off'. Be careful: it can take quite some time to
                         validate if you have a large database.

   - Quit              : Guess...

2. Edit
   - Delete selected   : Remove all selected entries at once.
   - Invert selected   : Invert the selected games - selected games are now
                         deselected and vice versa;
   - Duplicate Entry   : Duplicate the currently selected entry;
   - Create GIF-file   : Convert the currently displayed Spectrum screen image
                         to a GIF file, which will be created in the directory
                         you assigned in the configuration file (the `GIFPath'
                         value). The name of the image will have the same
                         PC-name as the game, with extension `.GIF'
   - Create SCR-file   : Convert the currently displayed Spectrum screen image
                         to a screenshot file, which will be created in a
                         subdirectory `SCRSHOT'. See `Game Screenshot Files'
                         for more information.
                         This option is disabled when the `ScrShot' button on
                         the screen is active, unless an `.SLT' file is being
                         handled. An `.SLT' file creates a `.SCR' file which
                         will not be viewable from the `ScrShot' button (as this
                         button takes the screenshot as found in the `.SLT' file
                         itself).
   - Fix TAP-file      : Remove noise parts (blocks with zero length) from the
                         selected game `.TAP' file.
                         Z80 crashes when it encounters such a block and it's
                         not nice to have noise anyway.
                         This option is meant for Z80-style `.TAP' files only!
   - View BASIC-part   : View the BASIC part from the snapshot. The listing is
                         shown in a seperate window, together with 2 buttons:
                         Drop Colors - Remove the colors from the output;
                         Remap UDGs  - Use UDGs as they are in the snapshot.
                         Save        - Look at the subject `Saving BASIC Blocks'
                                       further in this document.
   - View SCREEN-part  : View the SCREEN part from the snapshot. 
                         (see `.TAP Catalogs' below about this window)
   - View memory dump  : View the snapshot or selected TAP/MDR block as a memory
                         image dump in both HEX and ASCII.
   - TZX options       : This menu has a submenu:
     - Insert Hardware Type : Insert and edit a `Hardware Type' block;
     - Edit Hardware Type   : Edit the appointed `Hardware Type' block;
     - Insert Archive Info  : Insert and edit a `Archive Info' block;
     - Edit Archive Info    : Edit the appointed `Archive Info' block;
     - Insert Pokes         : Insert and edit a `Pokes' block;
     - Edit Pokes           : Edit the appointed `Pokes' block;
   - Call TAPER        : When the current game resides in a tape file or is a
                         .Z80 or .SNA snapshot, the external program TAPER can
                         be started to edit the tape file or play it to a real
                         Spectrum.
                         (see `Using TAPER in Conjunction with SGD' below)

3. System
   - Disable sounds    : Turn all sounds from SGD on/off. Has the same purpose
                         as the command line option `-q'.
   - Sound volume      : Set the volume of the soundcard. This adjusts the sound
                         volume of emulators that use a soundcard (e.g. `X128').
   - Emulate flash     : Emulate flashing characters when drawing a Spectrum
                         screen (see `The Configuration File' for details).
   - Slow flash        : Slow down the flashing timer to a third.
                         (see `The Configuration File' for details).
   - Always cheat      : Link the `Play' button to the `Pokes' button.
                         (see `The Configuration File' for details).
   - Best screen       : Link the `Screen' button to the `ScrShot' button.
                         (see `The Configuration File' for details).
   - Always select     : Always select the appointed game when using the
                         keyboard (see `The Configuration File' for details).

For those people who might wonder why you could possibly need more than one
database, I use five databases:

TEXTADV.DAT  - For all text adventures;
GAMES.DAT    - For all other games and demos of games;
DEMOS.DAT    - For all other demos;
UTILS.DAT    - For all utilities;
MISC.DAT     - For all cheats, spoilers and tapezines;


11. .TAP/.LTP CATALOGS
----------------------
A tape file reports the following information per file:

  1. (Expanded) Spectrum file name;
  2. Type of file: PROG, CODE, A-AR, N-AR, HEAD, ????;
  3. Depending on the type:
     PROG (Program)                 : Auto-start line or ----- if none;
     CODE (Code)                    : Startaddress of the code;
     A-AR (Alphanumerical Array)    : -
     N-AR (Numerical Array)         : -
     HEAD (Headerless block)        : The Flag byte;
     ???? (Unknown block)           : The Type byte;
  4. Length of the block.

Tape catalogs are of course printed in the original Spectrum font.
Blocks with zero length are reported as being noise (multiple blocks are
reported only once).
You can remove this noise with the menu option `Fix TAP-file' (under `Edit').

When a tape index is on the screen, you can double-click on a block if it is
of type CODE or HEAD. This opens a window where the selected block is
displayed as though it was a screen. This window also contains a `Make GIF'
and `Make SCR' button. To close it, you must either press [ESC] or use the
close gadget. This is useful for tape files that contain multiple screens.
A lot of tapes also have a screen with some bytes following it (remember that
a Spectrum screen is 6912 bytes), so it cannot be found when you press the
`Screen' button from the main screen. This option allows you to still watch
that screen!

The `Make SCR' button is used to make the shown screen a screenshot file,
which can be shown from the main window with the `ScrShot' button.
Notice that you cannot handle the tape combo window from the keyboard, as
this would conflict with the Game Select Window.

Sometimes, the startaddress of the block is not exactly the startaddress of
the Spectrum display area. I have some `.TAP' files where some bytes before
this address have been saved as well. This results in a `shifted' picture.
You will find a fine-adjust thingy in the window where you can adjust this
offset.

If you double-click on a PROG block, a window is opened where you can view the
BASIC listing (of course in the original Spectrum font).
The color attributes can be removed, so you can view it all.
UDG characters are in a different font and underlined, so you can see them
easily.
There is a `Save' button attached as well. Look at the subject `Saving BASIC
Blocks' further in this document.


12. .MDR CATALOGS
-----------------
A microdrive file reports the following information:

- Name of the cartridge, followed by an empty line. If the cartridge is write
  protected, reports `(Write protected)' in blue after it;
- Per file on the cartridge:
  1. (Expanded) Spectrum file name;
  2. Type of file: PROG, CODE, A-AR, N-AR, ????;
  3. Depending on the type:
     PROG (Program)                 : Auto-start line or ----- if none;
     CODE (Code)                    : Startaddress of the code;
     A-AR (Alphanumerical Array)    : -
     N-AR (Numerical Array)         : -
     ???? (Unknown block)           : The Type byte;
  4. Length of the block (Unless type ????).
  The files are sorted alphabetically (like the original);
  Hidden files are reported in red.
- An empty line, followed by the empty space in K, rounded down.

Microdrive catalogs are of course printed in the original Spectrum font.

Just like the .TAP indices, you can select blocks to view (see right above).


13. .TZX CATALOGS
-----------------
The new tape file format .TZX stores the tape blocks in exactly the same way as
the original tape. This makes the format the ultimate storage choise.
Several types of blocks are supported, including informational blocks.
SGD doesn't handle all these types, as that's what `TAPER' is for.
Contrary to TAP/LTP/MDR file types, blocks are reported splitted into header and
data.

- Header blocks are reported (in black) with the following info:
  1. (Expanded) Spectrum file name;
  2. Type of file: PROG, CODE, A-AR, N-AR, ????;
  3. Depending on the type:
     PROG (Program)                 : Auto-start line or ----- if none;
     CODE (Code)                    : Startaddress of the code;
     A-AR (Alphanumerical Array)    : -
     N-AR (Numerical Array)         : -
     ???? (Unknown block)           : The Type byte;
  4. Length of the block (Unless type ????).
- (Pure) Data blocks are reported (in black) with the length of the block.
- All other special types are reported in blue, between brackets.
  Where interesting, the length of the block is reported as well.

Just like the .TAP indices, you can select blocks to view (see right above).
This is done by clicking on the data block rather than the header block.
If the accompanying header suggests a BASIC block, the data will default to
BASIC view. Otherwise the default will be screen image view.
Informational blocks (in blue) cannot be displayed (yet), except blocks
`Hardware Type', `Archive Info', `Custom Info - Instructions' and `Custom Info -
Spectrum Screen'.

There's also a special submenu for TZX files under `Edit'.
The `Archive Info' block editor is special in that it is able to import/export
field data from/to SGD's entry data.


14. THE GAME INFORMATION FILE
-----------------------------
You can add information files to your game files. It has the same name as the
game file, but with extension `.TXT' (ASCII) or `.ZED' (ZX-Editor) and is to be
found in a subdirectory `INFO' (unless configuration option `AllFilesInOneDir'
is turned on).
For example: A game with full path:

    c:\spectrum\game.z80

will have an ASCII info file:

    c:\spectrum\INFO\game.TXT
                ----      ---
or ZX-Editor info file

    c:\spectrum\INFO\game.ZED
                ----      ---

ZX-Editor files are searched for first, ASCII files are checked otherwise.

This file can contain any information you like, such as:

- Goal of the game;
- Playing keys;
- Ratings, etc.

The file is shown if you press the `Info' button and can be edited/created
if you press the `EdInfo' button. The editor to be used must be supplied in
the configuration window. Before the editor is started, a test is done if the
`INFO' subdirectory exists. If it does not exist yet, you will be asked if it
should be created.
Lots of Spectrum game files from the internet have an information file added.
Just check the extension and you can view this file!

ZX-Editor files:

These are the files created with ZX-Editor from Claus Jahn and Andy Schraepel
and can contain just about anything you like, ranging from normal text to
complete graphics.
If you want to always create info files with this excellent editor, turn the
option `Always Use ZX-Editor' on in the configuration.
IMPORTANT NOTE: ZX-Edit does not appear to work under anything but plain DOS.

ASCII files:

An information file uses the following format:

- The length of each displayed line is 80 characters (special codes are not
  counted). If a line is longer, it wraps (at word boundaries) to the next
  line.
- Special codes can be inserted to control color and attributes of the
  characters in the file:

  {B   Start bold printing;
  {I   Start inverted printing;
  {U   Start underlined printing;
  {T   Start italics printing;
  {L1  Start ink-blinking (PC-style);
  {L2  Start invert-blinking (Spectrum-style);
  {+n  Change the foreground color to color n (see below);
  {++  Restore the foreground color;
  {+-  Change the foreground color to the background color;
  {+*  Change the foreground color to the bright color;
  {+/  Change the foreground color to the non-bright color;
  {-n  Change the background color to color n (see below);
  {--  Restore the background color;
  {-+  Change the background color to the foreground color;
  {-*  Change the background color to the bright color;
  {-/  Change the background color to the non-bright color;

  }B   End bold printing;
  }I   End inverted printing;
  }U   End underlined printing;
  }T   End italics printing;
  }L   Turn blinking off;
  }N   Restore all variables, this is the same as }B}I}U}T}L{++{--

  All other `{' and `}' sequences loose their sequence character, so you
  should use:

  {{   To get a single `{' character (`}{' will also do), or
  }}   To get a single `}' character (`{}' will also do).

  If you select both bold and italics, the result will be bold only.
  Chosing a blink type automatically ends the other blink type.

  Color values may take the values (* def. fore-, # def. background):

  COLOR          VALUE       COLOR          VALUE

* Black          0           Dark grey      8
  Blue           1           Light blue     9
  Green          2           Light green    A
  Cyan           3           Light cyan     B
  Red            4           Light red      C
  Magenta        5           Light magenta  D
  Brown          6           Yellow         E
# Light grey     7           White          F

  Please note that this is in VGA order, not Spectrum order!

  The following key-equivalents are available while viewing this file:

  [CURSOR UP]   - Go one line up;
  [CURSOR DOWN] - Go one line down;
  [PAGE UP]     - Go one page up;
  [PAGE DOWN]   - Go one page down;
  [ESC]         - Stop viewing.

  SLT Images:

  SLT files use an extension to store this information within the snapshot
  file itself.
  It is currently NOT possible to edit this, as the format is still undecided.
  I used the format proposed by Damien Burke:

  1. A line is max 64 characters in length;
  2. End-of-line is done with a single CR (as with e.g. Tasword)
  3. Bold is done by surrounding a string with `<B>' and `</B>' sequences;
     Underline is done by surrounding a string with `<U>' and `</U>' sequences;

  As soon as the format to be used is decided on, I'll adjust to this.

  If no information object is present in a .SLT file, you can set up a normal
  information file (in the usual format) which will be used as usual.


15. THE GAME SCREENSHOT FILE
----------------------------
You can add a screenshot file to your game files. It has the same name as the
game file, but with extension `.SCR' and is to be found in a subdirectory
`SCRSHOT' (unless configuration option `AllFilesInOneDir' is turned on).
For example: A game with full path:

    c:\spectrum\game.z80

will have a screenshot file:

    c:\spectrum\SCRSHOT\game.SCR
                -------      ---

Screenshot files can be created in different ways:
1. From within Z80. Press F10, choose `X - Extra options' and `Save screen or
   memory block'. Be sure to use the same name as the snapshot. You will have
   to move the created file into the screenshot directory yourself.
2. While viewing a game screen (the `Screen' button pressed): select menu
   entry `Make SCR-file' ([ALT][K]);
3. While viewing a TAP block image: select button `Make SCR'.

Before a screenshot a created, a test is done if the `SCRSHOT' subdirectory
exists. If it does not exist yet, you will be asked if it should be created.

As a lot of snapshots miss their loading screen, the `Screen' button will not
display it for you. This option allows you to still maintain these screens.
I found a lot of games on the internet have a screenshot file in the archive,
which can be viewed in this manner.

SLT files use an extension to store this information within the snapshot file
itself.  
If no screenshot object is present in a .SLT file, you can set up a normal
screenshot file which will be used as usual.

If you turn the `Best screen' configuration option on and you created a
screenshot file, this file will be displayed as well when you press the
`Screen' button, thus overriding a possibly ugly multifaced screen.


16. THE GAME INLAY FILE
-----------------------
You can add inlay files to your game files. It has the same name as the
game file, but with extension `.JPG' or `.GIF' and is to be found in a
subdirectory `INLAYS' (unless configuration option `AllFilesInOneDir' is turned
on).
For example: A game with full path:

    c:\spectrum\game.z80

will have an inlay file:

    c:\spectrum\INLAYS\game.JPG
                ------      ---
or

    c:\spectrum\INLAYS\game.GIF
                ------      ---

JPG files are searched for first, GIF files next. Only one file is used for a
game.
This file may contain any picture in any resolution you wish, since you have
to provide an external viewer yourself. If no viewer has been defined yet, a
wizard will pop up asking you for the location.
Examples of pictures can be cassette inlay scans or scanned maps as found in a
magazine.


17. THE GAME POKES FILE
-----------------------
You can add a pokes file to your game files. It has the same name as the
game file, but with extension `.POK' and is to be found in a subdirectory
`POKES' (unless configuration option `AllFilesInOneDir' is turned on).
For example: A game with full path:

    c:\spectrum\game.z80

will have a pokes file:

    c:\spectrum\POKES\game.POK
                -----      ---

Pokes files are created with the `EdPoke' button on the main screen and can
(only) contain the famous multiface pokes.

A lot of poke types need more than one poke operation to be done, so the
pokes window is set up as follows:
1. On the left side are all poke descriptions,
2. On the right side are all pokes that are needed to fullfill the currently
   selected poke description.

The following values are needed for a poke:

1. The memory bank;
   48K machines did not have banks, so this field is ghosted when you create
   a pokes file for such a game.
   128K games need this field to find out into which bank it should go.
   Notice that SGD will automatically insert the correct value when you give
   the address. You only need to change it by hand if explicitely mentioned.

2. The address (must be >= 16384 of course);

3. The poke value to activate the poke;
   To the right of this button is a cycle button. If you press this button,
   the value will change to `ASK'. This means that SGD will ask for the value
   when you start the poked game (`Poke' button). This is useful for pokes such
   as startlocations or the number of lives you want.

4. The original value, which de-activates the poke;
   This value can be retrieved from the snapshot by pressing the `Fetch' button
   next to this field.
   Notice that SGD will automatically fetch the correct value when you give the
   address.

To update a description or poke, just double-click the entry.

Once you have set up a pokes file, you can start a game in two ways:
1. The ordinary way, with the `Play' button or double-clicking, or
2. With the `Poke' button (just below the `Play' button).

When you press the `Poke' button, you will get a new window, containing all
pokes descriptions you entered. You can select the pokes you want to be
active in the usual way and then press the `Play' button in this window.
The game will then be copied to your `TMP' directory (see the note on the `TMP'
directory) with all selected pokes active, the game is started and when you
leave the emulator, the poked game is removed again.
All pokes with the Set field `ASK' will be asked at this time.
Cancelling this input requester will disable the poke.

Notice that all pokes that you did NOT select are poked at their Original
value. This is because I have some games that were already poked when put on
the internet (so the `Fetch' key will provide you with the poke value). If
you know the original value, this allows you to `remove' these pokes you
don't want!

When you have the option `Always cheat' on and start a game through `Play',
cancelling the poke select requester will allow you to play the game without
any pokes.

Important notes:
- You can only use pokes on snapshot files (`.Z80', `.SNA', `.SNP', `.SEM',
  `.SP' and `.SLT') and not on any other type (`.TAP', `.LTP', `.VOC', `.MDR'
  and `.TZX'), as these cannot be poked beforehand;
  Notice that you can create a pokes file for these types. If one is found,
  the `Poke' button will be kept ghosted, but the button text will be printed
  in normal font in stead if bold to indicate this.
- It largely depends on the moment in the game when the snapshot was taken
  whether the pokes will work or crash the game.
  I found quite a lot of snapshots that were taken immediately after the game
  was loaded, but the game auto-unpacks first (protection), so the pokes will
  not work yet. If you experience this, you should re-snap the game in a
  later point and use this snapshot instead (although you will usually have a
  worse looking snapshot...)
- `.SLT' files use an extension to store this information within the snapshot
  file itself.
  It is currently NOT possible to edit this, as the format is still undecided.
  If no pokes object is present in a .SLT file, you can set up a normal pokes
  file which will be used as usual.


18. DATABASE VALIDATION
-----------------------
Each time you select a game or change the path to a game, the entry is
re-validated. Validation includes finding the length of the file, finding and
testing the consistency of the filetype and adjusting the `playbit' of the game.
You can force SGD to automatically re-validate each database as it is loaded
or imported by turning on the `Auto-validate' menu entry (temporarily)
or the `ValidateAfterLoad' option in the configuration file (permanent).
You can also validate the current database by hand from the menu strip.
(see above)
My guess is that you will not have to validate very often (probably never),
and you should avoid it as much as you can, as it is a very timeconsuming
operation. The only reason to use it is when you reorganize the locations of
your game files.


19. GAME COMPRESSION
--------------------
If you're a bit like me and want to maintain an internet Spectrum archive, you
will need to have your games compressed. This is done from the menu strip.
First you must define the compressor program to be used, in your configuration
file (`Compressor'). If the compressor needs extra options, these can be defined
as well (`CompressOptions'). The usual compressor will be PKZIP (copyright by
PkWare Inc.), which is normally used on the internet.
A compressed game contains all material related to that game, i.e. if you had
a screenshot or a game information file, or the next levels are in a `.VOC' or
`.TAP' file or (level-loader) `.DAT' files, these are all included in the
archive.
When you select the compress option from the menu strip, you will see a
requester where you must confirm the action. Be sure that you want to do it, as
there is no way to back out once it has been started!
Each game is written to its own archive file, where the filename will be the
game PC-name, with an extension depending on the used compressor.
The usual location for compressed games is in a subdirectory `ZIPPED' from your
games (like the `INFO' and `SCRSHOT' subdirectories). In the confirmation
requester, you can choose a custom directory if this is not where you want them.

20.1. NOTES ON USING THE `Z80' SPECTRUM EMULATOR
------------------------------------------------
Z80 is the only shareware emulator, but the emulation is so good that it's
well worth registering.
This emulator has a `-g' (quiet) switch, which is also supported by SGD.
Special considerations:
1. EMS should be installed as well, as Z80 needs it for better 128K emulation.
2. SGD always keeps about 55Kb in low memory (DOS/4GW itself does this).
   As Z80 is a very low-memory-hungry emulator, make sure you enable EMS.
   You may also need to use the option `-xt' (low on memory) option, but this
   only works when inserted into the file Z80.INI
3. Be careful with the `-n' switch (no Interface I). If you have this switch
   in your Z80.INI, you will not be able to play `.MDR' files!
4. Z80 appears to have problems with switches on the command line (`Additional
   Switches'), so you should try to keep these in your Z80.INI
5. Since Z80 allows specifying both a snapshot and a tape file on the command
   line, tape auto-loading is possible (see `The Configuration' for more info),
   as well as having multiload games starting in a snap and continueing in a
   tape;
6. Z80 v3.05+ and SGD in Win95 do not go along at all. I experienced full crashes
   on exit of Z80 when called from within SGD. I can't tell what goes wrong,
   since Z80 never exits (although Z80 alone works perfectly!)....
   This problem is version dependant and seems to be related to Z80 v3.05 and up.
   If you experience this problem, take the following actions:
   - Place the file Z80STUB.EXE from the SGD package in the same directory as
     where your Z80.EXE file resides. This stub is automatically used when SGD
     detects Windows, so you can keep the start name to Z80.EXE.
   - Since Win95 will think that SGD keeps the soundcard locked while executing
     an emulator (which it doesn't!), you will need to run SGD with parameter
     `-S' (no soundcard). Do NOT use switch `-W', or Win95 will lock up your
     machine!
7. WinZ80 only accepts a filename as command line parameter. This works
   perfectly but disables use of the auto-load, joystick preselection or
   snap+tape features.


20.2. NOTES ON USING THE `WARAJEVO' SPECTRUM EMULATOR
-----------------------------------------------------
The Warajevo ZX Spectrum Emulator is the emulator with most options. There are
some important things to consider when you use this emulator though:
1. This emulator has 2 seperate emulator executables: `SPEC48.EXE' and
   `SPEC128.EXE'. When you setup the path to this emulator (From the
   configuration window or in the configuration file after `EmulatorPathWAR'),
   you MUST choose either one of these executables.
   Depending on your choise, SGD does the following:
   SPEC128.EXE : SGD will ALWAYS start the 128K Spectrum;
   SPEC48.EXE  : SGD will start the 48 or 128 Spectrum depending on the memory
                 type field of the game.
2. This emulator has a lot of (command line) options to improve emulation.
   Like the authors say in their documentation, each game will probably run
   best with a dedicated set of options passed.
   SGD supports only 1 set of options (`Extra Options'). You should choose the
   best overall combination. You can also setup a configuration file (see the
   Warajevo documentation) which is used in the same way.
   A lot of great features are lost when using SGD in stead of the database
   program supplied with Warajevo, but a lot of other features are returned.
   It's up to you which one you decide to use.
3. I would like to stress that `.TAP' files from Warajevo are NOT compatible
   with the `.TAP' files from Z80 (as you usually find them on the internet)!
   SGD supports only the Z80 version, so don't try to `List' a `.TAP' file
   created with Warajevo.
   To reduce possible confusion, I created the configuration option
   `Z80TapesOnly'. If turned on (default), all `.TAP' files on the database are
   considered created with Z80. If turned off (must be set by hand), you are
   responsible for remembering which `.TAP' files belong to which emulator.
4. You need version 1.5 to be able to play microdrive (`.MDR') files.
5. You need version 2.0 to be able to play `.TZX' files.
   Also, since v2.0, native support for Z80-style `.TAP' files has been added.
6. Since Warajevo allows specifying both a snapshot and a tape file on the
   command line, tape auto-loading is possible (see `The Configuration' for more
   info), as well as having multiload games starting in a snap and continueing
   in a tape;
   Warajevo also has a switch `/A' to auto-load tapes. However, games that must
   load in USR 0 mode are not recognised (of course), which SGD does!
7. Warajevo allows loading of non-native formats. Such images are on-the-fly
   converted to a native format, but this can only be done through the main
   program, named WARAJEVO.EXE. If you launch images of types `.SNA', `.SP',
   `.LTP', `.SLT', `.VOC', `.TZX' this main program is invoked instead.
   The memory type and joystick preselection options are then written in the
   file SPECSIM.CFG as described in the Warajevo documentation.
8. If you wish to use Warajevo from a CD-ROM, make sure you set the environment
   variable `WARAJEVO' to create temporary files elsewhere. The full syntax of
   this variable is
     WARAJEVO=[G|T] tmp-path
   where `[G|T]' is either `G' (for graphical) or `T' (for text, the default)
   user interface and `tmp-path' is the new path.
   For example, use
     set WARAJEVO=C:\TMP
   to set the directory for temporary files to C:\TMP (and use a text interface)
   See the Warajevo documentation for more information.
9. Warajevo emulates the +2 as well, so this model is selected if the memory
   type was set.


20.3. NOTES ON USING THE `X128' SPECTRUM EMULATOR
-------------------------------------------------
This emulator emulates nearly every Spectrum model you can imagine!
It was the first emulator that accepted the `.SLT' and `.TZX' file formats.
This emulator has a `/quiet' switch, which is also supported by SGD.
X128 doesn't have options to preset a joystick, so only `.Z80' and `.SLT'
type games can be forced to use a particular joystick (`ForceSnapJoystick').
Since X128 allows specifying both a snapshot and a tape file on the command
line, tape auto-loading is possible (see `The Configuration' for more info),
as well as having multiload games starting in a snap and continueing in a tape;
X128 emulates the +2/+2A (+2 mode selected), +3 and Pentagon as well, so these
models are selected if the memory type was set.
You need version 0.5 to be able to play microdrive (`.MDR') files.
You need version 0.7 to be able to play `.TZX' files.
You need version 0.8 to be able to play `.TRD' files.


20.4. NOTES ON USING THE `WSPECEM' SPECTRUM EMULATOR
----------------------------------------------------
WSpecEm is the first Spectrum emulator to run under (any version of) Windows.
Therefor, you cannot use command line switch '-W' (disable Windows) if you
want to use this emulator.
WSpecEm does not need command line options.
At the moment, WSpecEm emulates a 48K Spectrum only, but 128K emulation is to
be expected soon. SGD does not disallow 128K games to be passed to WSpecEm.
Please note that this emulator comes in two flavors:

- For Windows95 and NT (32-bits):
  This will pose no problems, as this Windows version will identify the
  emulator as a Windows program and act accordingly.
  When the emulator is started, SGD will return immediately, allowing you to
  start more than one instance of WSpecEm :)

- For Windows 3.x (16-bits):
  If SGD tries to call this version, you will receive the error message
  "This program must be run under Microsoft Windows." (argh!)
  I heard of the existence of a (shareware?) VxD that allows to call a Windows
  program from a DOS box, but never found it.
  If someone is able to pass me some info on this matter, please do!

WSpecEm doesn't have options to preset a joystick, so only `.Z80' and `.SLT'
type games can be forced to use a particular joystick (`ForceSnapJoystick').
You will want to use command line option `-S' to be able to let WSpecEm use
your soundcard.


20.5. NOTES ON USING THE `ZX' SPECTRUM EMULATOR
-----------------------------------------------
At the moment, only 48K Spectrums can be emulated.


20.6. NOTES ON USING THE `SPANISH SPECTRUM EMULATOR'
----------------------------------------------------
At the moment, only 48K Spectrums can be emulated.


20.7. NOTES ON USING THE `ZX-32' SPECTRUM EMULATOR
--------------------------------------------------
ZX-32 runs under 32-bit Windows, either Windows95 or Windows NT.
Therefor, you cannot use command line switch '-W' (disable Windows) if you
want to use this emulator.
ZX-32 does not need command line options.
ZX-32 doesn't have options to preset a joystick, so only `.Z80' type games
can be forced to use a particular joystick (`ForceSnapJoystick').
When the emulator is started, SGD will return immediately, allowing you to
start more than one instance of ZX-32 :)
You need v1.02 and up to be able to play `.TZX' files.
You will want to use command line option `-S' to be able to let ZX-32 use
your soundcard.


20.8. NOTES ON USING THE `R80' SPECTRUM EMULATOR
------------------------------------------------
This is the newest emulator and updates appear rapidly.
This emulator has a `-nosound' switch, which is also supported by SGD.
You MUST have v0.04 or up of this emulator, otherwise joystick preselection
will result in an error of the emulator!
R80 emulates the +2 (not +2A yet) and Pentagon as well, so these models are
selected if the memory type was set.


20.9. NOTES ON USING THE `RUSSIAN SPECTRUM EMULATOR' FROM SHALAYEV
------------------------------------------------------------------
This emulator comes with an extra package with loaders in it (.ADD files).
This package is needed if you want to run `.Z80' or `.SNA' files.
The package also adds support for `.TAP' files, but unfortunately not from the
command line. Therefore, `.TAP' files are not allowed to be run from SGD.
Since the emulator supports no command line switches other than loading an
image, memory type selection etc. must be done within the emulator itself.


20.A. NOTES ON USING THE `RUSSIAN SPECTRUM EMULATOR' FROM YUDIN
---------------------------------------------------------------


20.B. NOTES ON USING THE `REALSPECTRUM' SPECTRUM EMULATOR
---------------------------------------------------------
Setting options and selecting games for this emulator is done by rewriting the
appropriate lines of the REALSPEC.INI file.
This emulator has a `-nosound' switch, which is also supported by SGD.
Since this emulator allows specifying both a snapshot on the command line and a
tape file in the INI file, tape auto-loading is possible (see `The
Configuration' for more info), as well as having multiload games starting in a
snap and continueing in a tape;
RealSpectrum emulates the +2/+2A (+2a mode selected), +3 and Pentagon as well,
so these models are selected if the memory type was set.


21. CONVERTING YOUR DATABASES
-----------------------------
The database format has changed during 4 version updates, v1.30 being the last
one at the moment. You must convert your `old' databases with a command line
switch:

   Use `-c1' to convert from version 1.07 or below
   Use `-c2' to convert from version 1.09 or below
  (Use `-c3' to convert from version 1.17 or below)
  (Use `-c4' to convert from version 1.21 or below)
  (Use `-c5' to convert from version 1.29 or below)
  (Use `-c6' to convert from version 1.30 or below)
  (Use `-c7' to convert from version 1.35 or below)
  (Use `-c8' to convert from version 2.01 or below)

NOTES ON VERSION 1.09 AND BELOW:
- Converting should be done one database at a time.
- Be sure NOT to use the `Load Database' menu option within SGD to load the
  next database to be converted, as this doesn't work!

NOTES ON VERSION 1.10 AND UP:
- Auto-conversion is provided, even when using `Import' or `Load' from the menu
  strip, so options `-c3', `-c4', `-c5', `-c6', `-c7' and `-c8' are not
  required.

The converted database will be written back immediately if this is the first
database read.
The old, nonconverted version, is backed up first with extension .BAK
Notice that this extension is the normal backup extension.

The current database format is:

All fields are seperated with 1 space, each line is exactly 250 characters.
Numerical fields are aligned right, plain text fields are aligned left.

If you want to convert a database created with the `Warajevo ZX Spectrum
Emulator' to an SGD database, use the external program `CONVWARA'.
If you want to convert a database created with the `ZX-Rainbow Project' to an
SGD database, use the external program `CONVRAIN'.


22. USING A CUSTOM PALETTE
--------------------------
If you dislike the choises I made for the colors of the Spectrum, or you are
unable to see everything due to your (monochrome) monitor, or you just want to
see how weird Spectrum screens (and SGD itself for that matter) can look, you
can use a custom palette. The colors to be used must be set up in your
configuration file and you must turn `UseCustomPalette' ON.
The values `CustomColorXX' are in Spectrum order and bright colors have 8
added to their number (eg. bright red has number 10).
The values used must be supplied in hexadecimal, preceeded by the tag `0x' for
clearity. Both upper and lower case characters may be used in the number.

For users unfamiliar with the hexadecimal system, you only need to be aware of
the following simple rules:
1. While the decimal has base 10, hexadecimal uses base 16;
2. Digits above 9 are represented by letters starting with 'A', so
   `A' = 10, `B' = 11, `C' = 12, `D' = 13, `E' = 14 and `F' is 15.

The numbers themselves have the following format: `BBGGRR', where
`BB' holds the Blue color part,
`GG' holds the Green color part,
`RR' holds the Red color part.
As the chosen video mode has 6 bits per primary color, the largest allowed
number in each part is 3F. In other words, the color 0x3F3F3F will represent the
brightest possible white.

If you don't like the changes you made and want to try again but forgot the
original values, simply remove the `CustomColorXX' values from your
configuration file, start SGD, choose `Config' and `Save' to get fresh values.


23. USING LANGUAGES
-------------------
By default, SGD 'knows' of 5 default languages that games were written in:
English (Eng), Spanish (Spa), German (Ger), Polish (Pol) and Russian (Rus).
If you click on the page gadget right after the `Language' field, these are
the languages presented in the drop-down list.
If a game is in a language different from any of these (for example, in Dutch),
you cannot use the drop-down list, and have to edit the `Language' field
manually.
This can be annoying if you have a whole list of games from a specific country
that is not included in the list.
For this purpose, there's an option in the configuration file SGD.INI.
The option is named `AddLanguage' and the syntax is:

    AddLanguage = "xxx"

where 'xxx' is the 3-letter country-code you wish to use.
This option must be added manually by editing the file SGD.INI.
Once you added a language, it will appear in the drop-down list!
This option `AddLanguage' can be used multiple times, to add multiple languages.
The maximum is 255. Each language must be entered in its own line, such as

    AddLanguage = "Dut"
    AddLanguage = "Ita"


24. SAVING BASIC BLOCKS
-----------------------
You can save BASIC blocks of a program to ASCII.
The used filename will be the same as the game, but with extension `.BAS',
and the file will be put in the current directory.
The following conversions are used when saving:

   Chars   Displayed as

 Control codes:
   00-05   "{XX}", where XX is 2-digit hex, holding the value
   06      tab
   07-0C   "{XX}", where XX is 2-digit hex, holding the value
   0D      end of line
   0E      skipped
   0F      "{XX}", where XX is 2-digit hex, holding the value
   10-17   PAPER, INK, BRIGHT, FLASH, OVER, INVERSE, AT and TAB control
           characters are printed at e.g. "{PAPER x}"
   18-1F   "{XX}", where XX is 2-digit hex, holding the value

 Normal codes:
   20-7E   character it stands for
   7F      "{(C}}"

 Graphics:
   80-87   "{-X}", where X is 1-8 (the key to press)
   88-8F   "{+X}", where X is 1-8 (the key to press along with shift)
   90-A3   "{X}",  where X is 'A' - 'U'

 BASIC tokens:
   A4-FF   expanded token

The UDGs T and U are printed as token 'SPECTRUM' and 'PLAY' if a 128K listing
is being written.


25. MULTILOAD GAMES
-------------------
Lots of games load extra data while running. For example, several arcade games
load next levels.
One of the ways to store these is a tape format such as TZX or TAP, the Super
Level-loader Trap format SLT or the normal level-loader trap - a snapshot with
a set of DAT files.

Several programs on the net come in the form "snap + TAP/VOC". This allows for
instant start of a game, while retaining the ability to load extra data.
This setup is used so often that SGD has special options to support it.
The only thing to note is that the snap and TAP/VOC filename MUST be equal.
Only the extension may differ.

Note that only the emulators `Z80', `X128' and `Warajevo' have the ability to
select more than one filename, so only these emulators can handle MultiLoad
games that reside in more than 1 file.

The following options are available:

1. Through a special string at the end of the game name field.

   This option is 'prepared' in the configuration file SGD.INI

   Z80SnapNeedsTape : This string is searched for at the end of the game name
                      if this game is in a `.Z80' or `.SNA' file and the chosen
                      emulator is Z80 or X128. If it is found, the PC-file with
                      the same name but extension `.TAP' is inserted as a tape
                      file as well. This is used for programs of which the first
                      part is in a snapshot while the rest is in a tape.
                      E.g.: `Professional Adventure Writer' is in a `.Z80' file
                            while the character sets are in a `.TAP' file on
                            most internet sites. When this option is used, it
                            will play `PAW128K.Z80' and also insert the tape
                            file `PAW128K.TAP'
                      I use the string "+TAP)" myself.
   Z80SnapNeedsVOC  : Does the same as Z80SnapNeedsTape, but when the rest of
                      the program is in a `.VOC' file.
                      I use the string "+VOC)" myself.

2. Through the database field `MultiLoad'.

   If this flag is set (either `yes' or `48K') and the selected filename has
   extension .Z80 or .SNA, SGD will check if that filename is also available
   with extension .TAP or .VOC. If so, SGD will pass that file to the emulator
   as well.


26. USING TAPER IN CONJUCTION WITH SGD
--------------------------------------
First off, what is TAPER? TAPER is a tool to manipulate Spectrum tape files.
It also gives you the possibility to 'play' the tape files to an actual
ZX Spectrum, through a SoundBlaster compatible soundcard, parallel port
interface or serial/parallel port network. It runs in the same GUI environment
as SGD, so things will look pretty familiar.
It is being developed by 3 people: Tomaz Kac (who for instance developed the
.TZX file format and wrote HypraLoader), Martin Kopanske (the very first
registered user of SGD!) and me. You can download it from my site as well.
In order to use this combination, the TAPER program files must be in the same
directory as SGD.
When the currently selected game is in a tape file, you will see the menu entry
`Call TAPER' unghosted. Now, if you select this menu entry, TAPER is started as
a subprogram of SGD, loaded with your tape file.
If you selected command line option `-s' (disable Soundcard) or `-m' (disable
Mixer), TAPER will be disabled accordingly.
To use this feature, you MUST have TAPER version 1.02 or up.
You need TAPER v2.03 or up to be able to play .Z80 and .SNA files.
For more information about TAPER, have a look at its home base at:
   http://www.void.demon.nl/taper.html


27. TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------
Q: When I return from SGD to DOS, or when I start a shell from within SGD,
   the screen does not have a cursor, but I see a cursor-like line
   somewhere in the void. The font seems to have changed too. What happened?
A: I encountered this problem so far only when using MouseWare from Logitech.
   If you use Logitech's MouseWare, ensure that the VCI module `LVESA.OVL' is
   loaded and cursor enhancements are off.
   To do this, edit your `MOUSEDRV.INI' file. Look for the section `[Display]'
   and ensure that a line `VideoModule=C:\MOUSE\LVESA.OVL' is present (or
   whereever the `LVESA.OVL' file resides).
   Now, if you load your mouse driver (possibly from your `AUTOEXEC.BAT' file),
   load it with parameter `NOCENHANCE'.

Q: The mouse makes a mess of the screen! I don't like this at all!
A1:You have a Genius mouse with a driver version 7.02 or below.
   Genius mouse drivers v7.02 and below have a different approach for mouse
   hiding. If you use one, weird things can happen. Yet, no harm is done by
   this to the application nor your computer. Two solutions are available:
   1. Get yourself a newer mouse driver, or
   2. Turn the option `UseGeniusMouseHiding' on in the configuration file.
A2:You have a combination of an older (ISA) video card and an older mouse
   driver, which does not provide the RIL (Register Interface Library).
   Be sure that you turned the option `DirectVideoControl' off in `SGD.INI',
   as this disables the RIL.
   You can see if the RIL is present when pressing the `SysInfo' button.
   If a RIL is present, you will see a line `RIL version : xxxx' in the video
   section. If it is absent (or not used), you get `Control : Direct' instead.
   You can solve this problem in the following ways:
   1. If you are running SGD in a DOS-box from OS/2, update the box's
      parameters, so that compatibility mode is on.
   2. Use a newer, fully Microsoft compatible mouse driver, or
   3. Add the following line in your `CONFIG.SYS':
      DEVICE = EGA.SYS
      This device driver also provides the RIL.

Q: When I have SGD running, I can't see what's on the screen very well.
   Is there anything I can do about it?
A: Yes, you can use a custom palette to create better color contrast.
   See `Using a Custom Palette' for details.

Q: I print to a print queue (for example a Novell Netware captured LPT port).
   When I choose to print the database, it doesn't work!
A: SGD prints to the parallel port hardware directly. Queueing programs are
   unable to trap those operations. For this reason, I built LPT0: in the
   configuration. This will print to a file instead. Use this feature and
   print the file from DOS (or the shell) instead.

Q1:I run TAPER from Windows NT. The mouse cursor often stays in the 'waiting'
   cursor shape, until I move the mouse.
Q2:I run TAPER from Windows NT. The mouse cursor looks very weird.
A: Although Windows is from Microsoft, the emulated mouse cursor in a DOS box is
   absolutely NOT Microsoft compatible!  Talk about weirdos, eh!
   You should turn on the `NoLocalMouseHiding' in the configuration file. This
   will solve the screen problems, although the mouse will still look weird
   in Windows NT.

Q: I run SGD from a Windows (95) DOS-box. When I start it, it complains about
   a missing mouse driver. I'm using my mouse without problems within Windows
   though!
A: This is a common mistake. Windows and DOS each need their own mouse driver.
   The mouse driver from Windows cannot be used within DOS and vice versa.
   You should add a line in your `AUTOEXEC.BAT' to activate a mouse in DOS
   (or type it on the command line before starting SGD).
   If you upgraded from Windows 3.x to Windows95, the install program from
   Windows95 removed this line from your `AUTOEXEC.BAT' (or put `REM' in front
   of the line) for no appearant reason, so you should add it back and write a
   hate-mail to Bill Gates.

Q: When I run SGD from DOS, I get XMS version 3.0. But when I run SGD from a
   DOS-box in Windows 3.x, I get XMS version 2.0, although I didn't change my
   XMS driver. How's that possible?
A: Windows 3.x uses an internal, enhanced (yeah, right) XMS driver, which
   overrides the driver you installed already. This driver is actually A LOT
   slower (that's why they invented version 3.0!!!), but should work fine
   with SGD.

Q1:When I load a database, I get the fatal error `Percentage is [>100%]'!
Q2:When I load a database, I get the fatal error `Database found corrupt while
   reading entry [XXX]'
A: You have to convert your database to the new format of v1.30
   Please read the section `Converting Your Databases'.

Q: I adjusted the volume level for the PC-Speaker, but hear no difference.
A: You didn't connect the speaker connector on the mainboard to the soundcard.
   The internal speaker's volume cannot be altered by software.
